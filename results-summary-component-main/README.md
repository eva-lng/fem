## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this component deepend my understanding in several areas: 
- utilizing CSS grid and flexbox to create responsive, mobile first layouts
- HTML semantics and accessibility
- breaking down a design into smaller, reusable components

### Continued development

In the future, the layout could be refactored using React to create more reusable components and styled with a CSS framework such as Tailwind. This would achieve a more modular and maintainable component architecture, making the development process more efficient.
